        <h1 id="intro">Introduction to Internet</h1>
        <p>Computers and their structures are tough to approach, and it is made even extra tough while you want to recognize phrases associated with the difficulty this is already utilized in regular English, Network, and the net will appear to be
          absolutely wonderful from one some other, however, they may seem like identical.</p>


        <p>A network is a group of 1 or extra computer systems (Multiple gadgets, additionally called hosts), which are related through a couple of channels for the motive of sending and receiving records or media in a shared environment. The
          community
          also can consist of serval gadgets/mediums that resource communique among or extra machines; those gadgets are called Network devices and consist of routers, switches, hubs, and bridges, amongst others.
        </p>



        <p>Internet is a group of computer systems related from all around the world. The Internet protocol suite is a framework defined through the Internet standards. Methods are divided right into a layered set of protocols on this architecture.
          The
          Internet gives a huge variety of statistics and communique offerings, which includes forums, databases, email, and hypertext. It is made of the neighborhood to global personal, public networks connected through plenty of digital, wireless,
          and networking technologies.</p>
      
      <br>
      

        <h2>History of Internet</h2>
        <p>The ARPANET (later renamed the internet) established a successful link between the University of California Los Angeles and the Stanford Research Institute on October 29, 1969. Libraries automate and network catalogs outside of ARPANET in
          the
          late 1960s.</p>

        <p>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) is established in the 1970s, allowing internet technology to mature. The development of these protocols aided in the standardization of how data was sent and received via the
          internet. NSFNET, the 56 Kbps backbone of the internet, was financed by the National Science Foundation in 1986. Because government monies were being used to administer and maintain it, there were commercial restrictions in place at the
          time.</p>

        <p>In the year 1991, a user-friendly internet interface was developed. Delphi was the first national commercial online service to offer internet connectivity in July 1992. Later in May 1995, All restrictions on commercial usage of the
          internet are
          lifted. As a result, the internet has been able to diversify and grow swiftly. Wi-Fi was first introduced in 1997. The year is 1998, and Windows 98 is released. Smartphone use is widespread in 2007. The 4G network is launched in 2009. The
          internet is used by 3 billion people nowadays. By 2030, there are expected to be 7.5 billion internet users and 500 billion devices linked to the internet.</p>
          <h2>Working of Internet</h2>
          <p>The internet is a global computer network that connects various devices and sends a lot of information and media. It uses an Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP)-based packet routing network. TCP and IP work together
            to ensure that data transmission across the internet is consistent and dependable, regardless of the device or location. Data is delivered across the internet in the form of messages and packets. A message is a piece of data delivered over
            the internet, but before it is sent, it is broken down into smaller pieces known as packets.</p>
  
          <p>IP is a set of rules that control how data is transmitted from one computer to another via the internet. The IP system receives further instructions on how the data should be transferred using a numerical address (IP Address). The TCP is
            used with IP to ensure that data is transferred in a secure and reliable manner. This ensures that no packets are lost, that packets are reassembled in the correct order, and that there is no delay that degrades data quality.</p>
       
          <br>
        
          <h1 id="structure">Structure of Internet</h1>
          <p>The framework of the internet consists of multiple interconnected large networks. The large networks we called Network Service Providers (NSPs). UUNet, IBM, CerfNet, SprintNet, PSINet are well-known examples of NSPs. Packet traffic is
            exchanged among these peer networks. Each of the NSPs needs to be connected to three Network Access Points (NAPs). In NAPs traffic, packets have the provision to jump from one NSP to the backbone of another NSP. Metropolitan Area Exchange
            (MAEs) are also interconnected utilizing NSPs. MAEs and NAPs have the same functionality; however, MAEs are owned privately.</p>
  
          <p>Consequently, the original interconnection points were NAPs. In contrast, both (MAEs & NAPs) are referred to as Internet Exchange Points (IXs). NSPs provide services to other smaller networks that include ISPs. However, the backbone of a
            single NSP infrastructure is quite complicated to draw. However, mostly NSPs publish their infrastructure on the web related to networking maps. Drawing an accurate map of the internet is impossible due to several complexities that include
            size and evolution (change in structure) are the majors.</p>
        
        <br>
        
          <h2>Internet Address</h2>
          <p>Computers connected to the internet means that the systems are connected to computers’ worldwide network. Therefore, each machine/device has its own or unique address. Addresses of the internet are in the form “kkk.kkk.kkk.kkk,” where each
            “kkk” ranges from 0-256. This structure of the internet address is known as an IP address (Internet Protocol). Fig. 1 describes the connection between two computers using the internet. Both systems have unique IP addresses. However, the
            internet is a unique object between both systems.</p>
        
  
        <div class="content-images-holder">
          <img class="content-images" src="images/i-address-img.png" alt="">
        </div>
        
  
          <p> If a client connects the computer with the internet using Internet Service Provider (ISP), the client’s system is allocated a temporary internet protocol address till the session client is operating. However, if someone becomes part of
            the internet using a local area network (LAN), the client is probably assigned to a permanent internet protocol. At the time of connection, the system will have a unique internet protocol address. A handy program is named “Ping” to ensure
            the internet connection on the system; this provision is available on all the Microsoft Windows operating systems and sometimes on a flavour of Unix OS.</p>
        
        <br>
        
          <h2>Protocol Stacks and Packets</h2>
  
          <p>As the device is connected to the internet and retains a unique address. What is the procedure to communicate the device with the system at another end? For the sake of understanding, we are considering an example. As we discussed in
            Figure 1, one system retains an IP address, i.e., 173.196.95.98, and the second system contains an IP address, i.e., 162.194.60.98. Suppose you want to send a message “Hello Friend” to another computer via “Your computer”. The medium of
            communication will be the wire that connects “Your computer” to the internet. Suppose you are using ISP facilities, then the message will be communicated via the phone line of ISP. In such a case, the first message will be encrypted in
            digital form. All the alphanumeric characters will be converted into an electronic signal. The electronic signal will be delivered to the other computer and then again decrypted into the original form as received on the second IP system.
            The convergence of messages from alphanumeric form to a digital signal and vice versa is performed employing Protocol Stack that is part of each operating system, i.e., Windows, Unix, Android, etc. The protocol stack applied in the domain
            of the internet is known as TCP/IP, as it is the primary protocol used for communication.</p>
  
          <p>Fig. 2 briefly describes the path framework related to that message from “Your computer” to another computer.</p>
  
          <div class="content-images-holder">
            <img class="content-images" src="images/packets.png" alt="">
          </div>
  
  
          <ol>
            <li>The message that needs to be sent is written in an application on “Your computer” it starts from the top using the protocol stack and moves downward.</li>
            <li>If the message is large, the stack layer breaks the message into smaller chunks so that data management remains stable. The chunks of data are known as Packets.</li>
            <li>The data from the application layer move towards the TCP/IP layer. The packet of the data is assigned with a port number. In computers, various types of message applications are working at a time. Therefore, it is essential to know
              which application is sending the message so that it needs to be synced at the reception level (another computer) with the same application. Hence, the message will listen on the same port.</li>
            <li>After necessary processing at the TCP level, the packets move towards the IP layer. The IP layer provides the destination layer where the message should be received. At this level, message packets retain port number as well as IP
              address.</li>
            <li>The hardware layer is responsible for converting alpha/numeric messages into a digital signal and sending the message through the telephone’s path.</li>
            <li>Internet services provider (ISP) is also attached to the internet, where the ISP router examines the recipient’s address. The next stop of the packet is another router.</li>
            <li>Eventually, the packets reach another computer. This time packets start from the bottom.</li>
            <li>As the packets move upwards, the packets’ unnecessary data is removed that was helping to reach the destination; this includes IP address and port number.</li>
            <li>On reaching the stack’s top, all the packets are reassembled to form the original message sent by “Your computer”.</li>
          </ol>

          <h1>Client Server Architecture</h1>
          <p>The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions task or workload between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. In the client-server architecture, when
            the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and deliver the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources. Examples of
            Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.</p>
  
          <p>How the Client-Server Model works ?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Client: When we talk the word Client, it mean to talk of a person or an organization using a particular service. Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular
              service from the service providers (Servers).</li>
            <li>Servers: Similarly, when we talk the word Servers, It mean a person or medium that serves something. Similarly in this digital world a Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to particular services.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So, its basically the Client requesting something and the Server serving it as long as its present in the database.</p>

          </div>
          <p>How the browser interacts with the servers ?</p>
          <p>There are few steps to follow to interacts with the servers a client.</p>
  
          <ul>
            <li>User enters the URL(Uniform Resource Locator) of the website or file. The Browser then requests the DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM) Server.</li>
            <li>DNS Server lookup for the address of the WEB Server.</li>
            <li>DNS Server responds with the IP address of the WEB Server.</li>
            <li>Browser sends over an HTTP/HTTPS request to WEB Server’s IP (provided by DNS server).</li>
            <li>Server sends over the necessary files of the website.</li>
            <li>Browser then renders the files and the website is displayed. This rendering is done with the help of DOM (Document Object Model) interpreter, CSS interpreter and JS Engine collectively known as the JIT or (Just in Time) Compilers.</li>
  
          </ul>
  
          <div class="content-images-holder">
            <img class="content-images" src="images/csa-user.png" alt="">
          </div>
  
          <h2>Advantages of Client-Server model:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Centralized system with all data in a single place.</li>
            <li>Cost efficient requires less maintenance cost and Data recovery is possible.</li>
            <li>The capacity of the Client and Servers can be changed separately.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h2>Disadvantages of Client-Server model:</h2>
  
          <ul>
            <li>Clients are prone to viruses, Trojans and worms if present in the Server or uploaded into the Server.</li>
            <li>Server are prone to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.</li>
            <li>Data packets may be spoofed or modified during transmission.</li>
            <li>Phishing or capturing login credentials or other useful information of the user are common and MITM(Man in the Middle) attacks are common.</li>
          </ul>

          <h1 id="protocols">Protocols</h1>
          <p>Internet Protocols are a set of rules that governs the communication and exchange of data over the internet. Both the sender and receiver should follow the same protocols in order to communicate the data. In order to understand it better,
            let’s take an example of a language. Any language has its own set of vocabulary and grammar which we need to know if we want to communicate in that language. Similarly, over the internet whenever we access a website or exchange some data
            with another device then these processes are governed by a set of rules called the internet protocols.</p>
          <p> <b> Working of internet protocol:</b> The internet and many other data networks work by organizing data into small pieces called packets. Each large data sent between two network devices is divided into smaller packets by the underlying
            hardware and software. Each network protocol defines the rules for how its data packets must be organized in specific ways according to the protocols the network supports. </p>
          <h2>Why do we need protocols?</h2>
          <p>It may be that the sender and receiver of data are parts of different networks, located in different parts of the world having different data transfer rates. So, we need protocols to manage the flow control of data, access control of the
            link being shared in the communication channel. Suppose there is a sender X who has a data transmission rate of 10 Mbps. And, there is a receiver Y who has a data receiving rate of 5Mbps. Since the rate of receiving the data is slow so some
            data will be lost during transmission. In order to avoid this, the receiver Y needs to inform sender X about the speed mismatch so that the sender X can adjust its transmission rate. Similarly, the access control decides the node which will
            access the link shared in the communication channel at a particular instant of time. If not the transmitted data will collide if many computers send data simultaneously through the same link resulting in the corruption or loss of data.</p>
        
        <br>
  
        
          <h1 id="protocols-type">Types of Protocols</h1>
          <p>The Internet Protocols are of different types having different uses:-</p>
  
          <h2>1. TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol):</h2>
          <p>These are a set of standard rules that allows different types of computers to communicate with each other. The IP protocol ensures that each computer that is connected to the Internet is having a specific serial number called the IP address. TCP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet and how it should be broken into IP packets. It also makes sure that the packets have the information about the source of the message data, the destination of the message data, the sequence in which the message data should be re-assembled, and checks if the message has been sent correctly to the specific destination.</p>
  
          <p>The functionality of TCP/IP is divided into 4 layers with each one having specific protocols:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> <b>Application Layer:</b>  The application layer makes sure that the data from the sending end is received in a format that is acceptable and supported at the receiving end.</li>
            <li><b>Transport Layer:</b> The transport layer is responsible for the smooth transmission of data from one end to the other. It is also responsible for reliable connectivity, error recovery, and flow control of the data.</li>
            <li><b>Internet Layer:</b> This Internet Layer moves packets from source to destination by connecting independent networks.</li>
            <li><b>Network Access Layer:</b> The Network Access Layer sees how a computer connects to a network.</li>
          </ol>
  
          <h2>2. SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):</h2>
          <p>hese protocols are important for sending and distributing outgoing emails. This protocol uses the header of the mail to get the email id of the receiver and enters the mail into the queue of outgoing mails. And as soon as, it delivers the mail to the receiving email id, it removes the email from the outgoing list.</p>
  
          <h2>3. PPP(Point to Point Protocol):</h2>
          <p>It is a communication protocol that is used to create a direct connection between two communicating devices. This protocol defines the rules using which two devices will authenticate with each other and exchange information with each other. For example, A user connects his PC to the server of an Internet Service Provider also uses PPP. Similarly, for connecting two routers for direct communication it uses PPP.</p>
  
          <h2>4. FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</h2>
          <p>This protocol is used for transferring files from one system to the other. This works on a client-server model. When a machine requests for file transfer from another machine, the FTO sets up a connection between the two and authenticates each other using their ID and Password. And, the desired file transfer takes place between the machines.</p>
  
          <h2>5. SFTP(Secure File Transfer Protocol):</h2>
          <p>SFTP which is also known as SSH FTP refers to File Transfer Protocol (FTP) over Secure Shell (SSH) as it encrypts both commands and data while in transmission. SFTP acts as an extension to SSH and encrypts files and data then sends them over a secure shell data stream. This protocol is used to remotely connect to other systems while executing commands from the command line.</p>
  
          <h2>6. HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol):</h2>
          <p>This protocol is used to transfer hypertexts over the internet and it is defined by the www(world wide web) for information transfer. This protocol defines how the information needs to be formatted and transmitted. And, it also defines the various actions the web browsers should take in response to the calls made to access a  particular web page. Whenever a user opens their web browser, the user will indirectly use HTTP as this is the protocol that is being used to share text, images, and other multimedia files on the World Wide Web. </p>
  
          <h2>7. HTTPS(HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):</h2>
          <p>HTTPS is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network with the SSL/TLS protocol for encryption and authentication. So, generally, a  website has an HTTP protocol but if the website is such that it receives some sensitive information such as credit card details, debit card details, OTP, etc then it requires an SSL certificate installed to make the website more secure. So, before entering any sensitive information on a website, we should check if the link is HTTPS or not. If it is not HTTPS then it may not be secure enough to enter sensitive information.</p>
  
          <h2>8. TELNET(Terminal Network):</h2>
          <p>TELNET is a standard TCP/IP protocol used for virtual terminal service given by ISO. This enables one local machine to connect with another. The computer which is being connected is called a remote computer and which is connecting is called the local computer. TELNET operation lets us display anything being performed on the remote computer in the local computer. This operates on the client/server principle. The local computer uses the telnet client program whereas the remote computer uses the telnet server program.</p>
  
          <h2>9. POP3(Post Office Protocol 3):</h2>
          <p>POP3 stands for Post Office Protocol version 3. It has two Message Access Agents (MAAs) where one is client MAA (Message Access Agent) and another is server MAA(Message Access Agent) for accessing the messages from the mailbox. This protocol helps us to retrieve and manage emails from the mailbox on the receiver mail server to the receiver’s computer. This is implied between the receiver and receiver mail server.</p>
